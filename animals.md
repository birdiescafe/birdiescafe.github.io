# Birdies &heart; Animals

During our time in Central Oregon we have rescued many, many animals.  We want to make a difference in the way all animals are treated. 

That’s why we are feathering the nest for a different  non-profit animal organization each quarter.

## Help feather the nest and build a better community for animals

Birdies will match up to $300 to the quarterly non-profit. Donation opportunity with your bill.
